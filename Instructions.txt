Computer Brain v2.0 assembly instructions:

The CPU goes at the bottom on the board under the LED matrix.

    1. Solder 40 pin socket for the 6502 and the 8 pin for the 555 IC in their spots as they will be the lowest profile. Note the notches directions on the board.
    2. Solder the 51R resistors to R9 thru R24 at the top of the board. Solder the 1k resistors to R1 thru R8 and R26. Then solder the 10k resistor in to R25.
        a. To fit the resistors fold one lead over so the leads are pointing the same direction.  As shown.

    3. Solder the 2.2uF capacitor into C1. Make sure you have the polarity correct with the Negative side with the stripe.
    4. The 102 capacitors goes into C2 and C3. 
    5. Please Note: the dip switch MUST be installed upside down.  The number 1 is on the right and the word “ON’ will now read “NO” (This way down is a “0” bit and up is “1” bit when programming.)
    6. Now connect the reset button and potentiometer.
    7. Solder the 48 LEDs with the anode towards the bottom of the board. 
    8. Connect USB.
    9. Solder the 6502 and 555 IC directly in or insert chips into socket. Note the notches directions on the board.
